CDB functions for PHP
=====================

This library wraps the constant database (CDB) functionality exposed in PHP
via the dba_* functions. In cases where dba_* functions are not present or
are not compiled with CDB support, a pure-PHP implementation is provided for
falling back.

Documentation about the library can be found on [MediaWiki.org](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/CDB).

More information about CDB itself can be found at http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html.
